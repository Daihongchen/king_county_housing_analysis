## Housing Analysis Memo

After review of the housing and sales data in King County, we can confirm that roughly 50% of the variation in sales price can be predicted by only 5 features of the home.

The 5 features in question are:  
    1) Squre Footage of the Home  
    2) View Quality of Lake Washington  
    3) Square Footage of the Porch (if there is one)  
    4) Waterfront Property Status  
    5) Square Footage of the Garage  
    
While 50% is not the entirety of the home, this data provides an excellent baseline for home owners and real estate agents to estimate the value of the home.

All of these factors drastically affect value. The sale price increases by roughly 370USD per square foot of living space, and roughly 214USD per square foot of porch space. Being on the water increases homes by an average of 860,000 USD, while the view quality of Lake Washington increases price by 350,000USD per categorical increase in quality. Interestingly enough, garage space actually lowers sale price by about 270USD per square foot. We interpreted the last item as representing a greater desire for living space in an area where home prices are on the rise and space is becoming more expensive.

## Future Analyses

Moving forward, we would advise our next model to account for population density, quality of public schools, and crime rates.
